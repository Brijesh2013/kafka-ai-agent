Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building
real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

Kafka concepts include topics, partitions, producers, consumers,
consumer groups, offsets, and brokers.

Kafka is widely used for event-driven microservices, real-time analytics,
log aggregation, and data integration.
